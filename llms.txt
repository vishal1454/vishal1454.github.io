# llms.txt for Vishal K

Name: Vishal K
Nickname : vishal1454 , appmakervishal , mr.hacker , vishal K
GitHub: vishal1454 / appmakervishal
Role: Programmer / Independent Tech Builder  
Location: India

## Overview
Vishal is a self-driven programmer and independent tech builder who focuses on understanding how systems *actually* work under real-world constraints. His work spans web technologies, Linux-based systems, browser internals, DNS/email infrastructure, cybersecurity fundamentals, and community-driven development.

Rather than relying on abstractions alone, Vishal prefers hands-on experimentation: breaking systems, observing limitations, and rebuilding lightweight solutions that work even in restricted environments such as browsers, sandboxed iframes, free hosting platforms, or low-resource systems.

## Technical Journey
Vishal’s learning approach is strongly practical and exploratory. He actively experiments with:
- Running unconventional or non-native programming languages inside browsers (without WASM)
- Understanding browser sandboxing, security boundaries, and permission models
- Building custom Linux-based systems, live environments, and ISO workflows
- Designing infrastructure using free and open tools while respecting real constraints
- Reverse-engineering platform behavior to find safe, practical workarounds

This mindset shapes all his projects and community contributions.
